   notes/notes.js — the knowledge-notes manifest.

   THIS IS THE ONE FILE YOU EDIT TO ADD A NOTE.

   To add a note:
     1. Copy notes/_template.html to notes/<your-slug>.html and write it.
     2. Add an entry to the TOP of the NOTES array below.

   Entry shape:
     {
       slug:    "your-file-name-without-.html",   // -> notes/your-file-name.html
       title:   { zh: "中文标题", en: "English title" },
       summary: { zh: "一句话摘要", en: "One-line summary" },
       date:    "2026-05-29",                      // ISO date, used for sorting
       tags:    ["LLM", "Training"]                // free-form, also build the filter bar
     }

   Notes are sorted by `date` descending automatically — order here doesn't
   matter, but keeping newest on top is tidy.

   `title` / `summary` may also be a plain string instead of a {zh, en}
   object if you don't want a translation; it will show for both languages.
